# MultiRun

The goal behind "MultiRun" is to bring simple multi-tasking capabilities to *.BAT CMD Scripts in Windows.

This is a utility program (exe) for use with batch scripts that is a successor to "Project Multibat" (which had similar goals but was implemented using only .bat files)

"MultiRun" should be faster, more featured, and more accurate than "MultiBat" - but it does require an exe rather than just batch files.

The original "Project Multibat" is here for reference https://github.com/adisak/MultiBat
